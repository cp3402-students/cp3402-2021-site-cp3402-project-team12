To continue developing the Team 12 Theme, clone the following repository https://github.com/BeauWilliams97/cp3402-2021-site-cp3402-project-team12.git
Use an IDE to edit the .php files.
The Team 12 theme is pretty basic. 
The main features that might need maintaining are the header image/ header banner.
There might also be some issues with the boostrap icons in the footer. You might need to update this in the future.
If changing the colours of the theme make sure the logo still stands out. It is quite intricate and contains a solid black silhouette, so it does not mix well with dark backgrounds.

In order to add new content you would add it as a page.
To maintain the site just edit the pages.
If new content were to be added and a new developer would like to continue developing on our wordpress site.
This could be done by changing it directly via the livesite on wordpress, with admin priviliges. Or opening
the theme folder up on a web code software such as phpstorm, and messing around with the css style files.
These new updates would be pages rather than posts, categorized as a landing page.
